A few rules:

* For every new blog post you should generate a new uuid and
  specify it via the `.. blog:guid::` directive.

* The `.. blog:draft::` can be used to mark the post as a
  draft. Draft blog posts are only rendered in development
  and on staging sites.

  (The `SHOW_DRAFT_BLOG_POSTS` environment variable controls
  their visibility.)
