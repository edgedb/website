    With this Beta 2 release, EdgeDB stabilizes in preparation for our 1.0
    launch. Plus, we introduce a new interactive tool for configuring EdgeDB
    projects.

Announcing EdgeDB Beta 2: Luyten
================================

Looking to another nearby star, we're pleased to announce the second public
beta of EdgeDB: Luyten!

.. note::

    Luyten 726-8, also known as Gliese 65, is a binary star system that is one
    of Earth's nearest neighbors, at about 8.7 light years from Earth in the
    constellation Cetus. Luyten 726-8B is also known under the variable star
    designation UV Ceti, being the archetype for the class of flare stars.

Back in February 2021, we released the first beta version of EdgeDB after three
years in development and 7 alpha releases. Since then, we've shifted focus from
implementing new features to improving stability and performance. And we did:
this release is the culmination of 10 weeks of fixes and enhancements.

But we couldn't help ourselves! We're excited to introduce a new interactive
CLI tool called ``edgedb project``â€”a project scaffolding tool that makes the
process of setting up an EdgeDB-powered project even easierâ€”, plus Deno
support, customizable transaction settings for our client libraries, and more!

What's EdgeDB?
==============

EdgeDB is an advanced `open source <github_>`_ relational database based on
PostgreSQL. The project aims to give developers and data engineers a highly
efficient and productive database technology while addressing the `shortcomings
of SQL <bettersql_>`_ and its surrounding ecosystem.

It takes the best features of ORMs and GraphQLâ€”declarative schemas, migrations,
easy deep fetchingâ€”and bakes them into a strict relational database:

* a high-level data model and type system;
* a powerful, expressive and extensible query language called EdgeQL
* first-class support for schema migrations;
* support for converting arbitrary strictly typed data to and from JSON via a
  simple cast operator;
* out-of-the-box interoperability via REST and GraphQL;
* first-party database clients JavaScript, Go, and Python.


Installing Beta 2
=================

To upgrade to Beta 2, you'll first need need to install the latest version of
our CLI.

**If you already have an version installed**, just run ``edgedb self-upgrade``
to get the latest CLI, then run ``edgedb server upgrade``.

**If you've never used EdgeDB before**, you can install the CLI with a single
command:

.. code-block:: shell

    # macOS/Linux
    $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.edgedb.com | sh

    # Windows
    $ iwr https://ps1.edgedb.com/ -useb | iex

Then run ``edgedb server install``.

Once you've got the latest versions of the CLI and EdgeDB, you're ready to get
started. And getting started is easier than ever before!

**Upgrade your instances**

To upgrade an existing EdgeDB instance to Beta 2:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ edgedb server upgrade my_instance

Or upgrade all instances simultaneously:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ edgedb server upgrade


Introducing ``edgedb project``
==============================

The primary new feature of Beta 2 is the addition of ``edgedb project`` to our
CLI and its associated ``edgedb.toml`` config file, which lives in your project
root directory.


Turn any directory on your computer into an "EdgeDB Project" by running
``edgedb project init`` inside it. This command does a lot:

- It scaffolds your project by creating a ``dbschema`` folder and an empty
  ``dbschema/schema.esdl`` inside it (if they don't already exist).
- It prompts you to either create a new EdgeDB instance on your machine or
  specify an existing one that's already running on your computer.
- It creates a **link** between that instance and the current project
  directory. This link is recorded in the ``~/.edgedb/projects`` directory.
- It generates an ``edgedb.toml`` file if it doesn't already exist. This
  identifies the directory as an EdgeDB Project. Check this file into version
  control so it's easy for others to easily spin up a local EdgeDB instance for
  this project.

Once your project is initialized, you no longer need to use connection flags in
CLI commands. Instead of  ``edgedb -I my_instance migrate``, you can simply run
``edgedb migrate`` inside your project directory! ðŸŽ‰

Plus, you no longer need to provide an instance name or set environment
variables with connection information if you're using one of EdgeDB's
first-party client libraries for `JavaScript/TypeScript
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js>`_, `Python
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python>`_, and `Go
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-go>`_). The library automatically detects the
``edgedb.toml`` file and connects to the linked instance automatically.

For a more complete explanation of how to get started with ``edgedb project``,
read the dedicated post: `Introducing EdgeDB Projects
</blog/introducing-edgedb-projects>`_.


Deno support
============

Deno users: you can now use the EdgeDB JS/TypeScript client! It's available for
immediate import on ``deno.land/x``.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import * as edgedb from "https://deno.land/x/edgedb/mod.ts"

    const conn = await edgedb.connect();

    // (for remote instances)
    // const conn = await edgedb.connect(
    //   "edgedb://edgedb@example.com/test"
    // );

    // run a query
    const result = await conn.queryOneJSON(`SELECT 2 + 2;`);
    result; // => 4


Customizable retry logic
========================

Beta 1 introduced best-in-class automatic retrying and transaction logic across
EdgeDBs first-party client libraries for `JavaScript/TypeScript
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js>`_, `Python
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python>`_, and `Go
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-go>`_. For more information, read the `Robust
Client API RFC
<https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1004-transactions-api.rst>`_.

Now, we've made every aspect of that logic configurable. You can override the
default transaction & retry settings for your connection pool with the
immutable ``withTransactionOptions`` and ``withRetryOptions`` methods. The
example below uses the TypeScript client but there are equivalent APIs for
Python and Go. Read the docs to learn the syntax for your preferred language.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import * as edgedb from "./index.node";

    async function main() {
      const defaultPool = await edgedb.createPool();

      const retryOptions = new edgedb.RetryOptions(
        5, // defaults to 3
        edgedb.defaultBackoff // (attemptNo: number)=>number
      );

      const transactionOptions = new edgedb.TransactionOptions({
        // defaults to RepeatableRead
        isolation: edgedb.IsolationLevel.Serializable,
        // defaults to false
        readonly: true,
        // defaults to false
        deferrable: true,
      });

      const customizedPool = defaultPool
        .withTransactionOptions(transactionOptions)
        .withRetryOptions(retryOptions);

      await customizedPool.retryingTransaction(async (tx) => {
        await tx.queryJSON(`SELECT User FILTER id = <uuid>`, {});
      });
    }

.. note::
    :class: aside

    **Note:** The ``createPool`` API is deprecated in our latest client
    bindings. It has been replaced with the :js:func:`docs:createClient`
    API, see our :ref:`RC2 blog post <ref_rc2_pool>` for more details.

By default all transactions are executed using the ``RepeatableRead`` isolation
level. You can now customize transactions to run as ``Serializable`` instead,
and explictly mark transactions as readonly or deferrable. Read more about
these terms in the Postgres `Transaction docs
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set-transaction.html>`_.

You can also specify the max number of retries (defaults to 3) and a custom
exponential backoff function, which defaults to this:

.. code-block:: typescript

    export function defaultBackoff(attemptNo: number): number {
      return 2 ** attemptNo * 100 + Math.random() * 100;
    }


DESCRIBE SCHEMA AS SDL
======================

For instances running EdgeDB 1.0 Beta 2 or later, you can now introspect the
current schema as SDL with the ``DESCRIBE SCHEMA AS SDL`` DDL command. This is
useful if you want to conveniently compare your local schema file(s) to the
instance's current schema state. Just open a repl and run the command:

.. code-block::

    $ edgedb -I my_instance
    edgedb> DESCRIBE SCHEMA AS SDL;
    {
      type default::User {
        required property name -> std:str;
        # ...
      }
    }

    # ...
