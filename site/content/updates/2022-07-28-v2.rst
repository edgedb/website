EdgeDB 2.0
==========

Today, just under 6 months after the release of 1.0 🏁, we're excited
to announce EdgeDB 2.0.

This release brings a slew of new features, including:

* a built-in admin UI;
* a top-level GROUP statement in EdgeQL;
* object-level security;
* range types;
* an official Rust client library (at long last!)
* ...and a lot more.
