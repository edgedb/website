Dev Report
==========

Welcome to EdgeDB Dev Report -- bi-weekly or so updates about the latest in
EdgeDB development. Here's some bites for you:

* **Scott** is working on `speccing <net_>`_ and implementing a new
  ``std::net::`` module to bring HTTP requests and 🪝 Webhooks to EdgeDB.

* **Dijana** is about to complete a "mini-StackOverflow" section of our
  Documentation, fed by questions you ask on our 💬 `Discord <discord_>`_.

* **Matt** is rewriting our EdgeDB <> PostgreSQL communication in 🦀 Rust. Just
  recently he RIIR'ed our backend connection pool and we're about to make
  the new pool the default.

* **Aleksandra** is creating a swath of new project templates for Next.js
  and EdgeDB. From time to time we find her reading the Replicache docs for
  no apparent reason 😉.

* **Sully** is putting last finishing touches on the new "in-place upgrades"
  feature of EdgeDB 6. So you can update your database server version without
  running full dump/restore (for some reason our users want that 🤯.)

* **Aljaz** is close to finalizing his epic project on implementing
  write SQL support in EdgeDB. He's currently busy enabling 🔐 access policies
  for SQL queries.

* **Roman** has started designing a website for a new secret project.
  Completely out of the blue he's researching molecular properties of gels
  and liquid metals 🔬.

* **Zack**, **Elvis**, and the cloud team are keeping our Cloud running
  and working on improving our infra. BTW, we're looking for experienced
  SREs and Cloud Engineers 👷‍♀️, `drop us a line <mailto:jobs@edgedb.com>`_.

* **James** was last seen adding major new UI features 🫡 for EdgeDB and the
  Cloud.

* **Victor** is wrapping up his work on bringing 📍 PostGIS to EdgeDB 6.
