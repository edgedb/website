    We’re bringing a unique vinyl record with us to PyCon 2023!


========================
The Zen Side of the Moon
========================

Back in 2020, before covid interrupted all plans, EdgeDB asked members of the
Python community to take part in a unique project: a one-off vinyl record with
musical contributions from Pythonistas. A physical album that was supposed to
be auctioned off at PyCon US 2020 to support PyLadies. We're happy to announce
that it will be part of this year's PyLadies Auction in Salt Lake City!

The covid years interrupted plenty of plans. PyCon US was supposed to take
place in Pittsburgh, and the annual Core Python Sprint was planned at Google.
Suddenly, everything got canceled. Many events could transition to an
online-only form. We did our best to participate and even co-organize some.
Sadly, not everything translates well to the virtual world. The online core
sprints weren't the same as in-person collaboration, and the online conferences
lacked the “hallway track”. Similarly, we felt that the annual PyLadies Auction
during PyCon US works best as a live event.

Fortunately, some of the events and related plans that were canceled in 2020
turned out to be only postponed. The Core Python Sprint at Google `did
eventually happen in October 2022
<https://blog.python.org/2022/10/python-core-development-sprint-2022-311.html>`_.
PyCon US returned to its in-person form in 2022, too. Turns out we won't even
miss Pittsburgh as PyCon US 2024 and 2025 will happen in that city!

This year we're returning to Salt Lake City, and we're bringing the unique
vinyl record with us!

Why support PyLadies?
=====================

Before we get to why you should bid high on that record in particular, it's
worth talking a bit about the `PyLadies <https://pyladies.com/>`_ and why they
are a worthy target of your charitable contributions.

PyLadies is an international mentorship group for underrepresented genders in
tech, such as but not limited to women, non-binary people, and trans people.
It focuses on helping our community become active participants and leaders in
the Python open-source community.

There are `over 120 chapters <https://pyladies.com/locations/>`_ of PyLadies
all over the world, organizing meetups, workshops, and online resources to
elevate their members and the greater programming community.

Track by track
==============

1. Liberty Bell
---------------

Python, the programming language, takes its name from Monty Python's Flying
Circus. What better way to start the album than with the march used in its
opening credits?

Masterfully performed by icons of Python education: David Beazley and Nicholas
Tollervey. There's also a crucial contribution at the end from Guido himself.

2. Wagon Wheel
--------------

Brandon Rhodes, a well-known Python teacher, opted for a song by the Old Crow
Medicine Show. In the style of folk Bob Dylan, the nostalgic tune features a
harmonica solo. Brandon sings and plays guitar in the song.

3. Feeling Good
---------------

Lynn Root, working at Spotify but known worldwide for being the Chair of the
PyLadies Global Council, plays bass in this evergreen blues standard. It's a
powerful rendition starting with loungey Rhodes piano with delicate percussion
and transitioning to all-out distorted guitar mayhem. Alex Simonoff sang, Peter
Sobot performed and produced the song.

4. Black Hole Sun
-----------------

In early 2020 the auto-formatter Black was rising in popularity. Those were the
days of considerable controversy but also big excitement! For my own
contribution to the record, I was looking at songs that would play on this
association. Ultimately, it was a coin toss between this Soundgarden banger
and “Black” by Pearl Jam.

How does it sound? Think: “What if Black Hole Sun but played by Nine Inch
Nails?” Sadly, it's not Trent on the vocals.

5. First Steps
--------------

Alethea Flowers contributed this delicate chiptune-style cover from the
soundtrack to the game “Celeste”. Amazingly, the track is performed on a
synthesizer that Alethea herself made. She later went on to found `a business
that specializes in eurorack synthesizer modules <https://winterbloom.com/>`_,
including ones that you can program in CircuitPython.

6. Fruitless Labors
-------------------

Did you know that Larry Hastings plays the piano? He does, and he's good, too!
But did you know he can sing just as well? This Brian Dewan song is an
excellent showcase of his skills on both fronts.

7. I Am The Walrus
------------------

Emily Morehouse-Varcarcel currently serves as a Python Steering Council member.
Back in 2020, she was responsible for the implementation of the most
controversial feature of Python 3.8: the assignment expression, known
affectionately as the walrus operator.

It's quite a coincidence she's also a great singer. Her rendition of the
surreal “I Am The Walrus” from 1967 proves this while also fitting so well with
the theme of her core Python contribution. I worked on the arrangement for the
song on a trip to Malta, my last pre-covid vacation.

8. Django
---------

Steve Dower is the Windows expert within the Python core team. After hours he
can hold his own at the jazz piano. This piece by John Lewis has it all: a
brooding late-night impromptu intro, ragtime, and a classical ballad finale.

9. Asturias
-----------

Who is Pablo Galindo Salgado? A member of the Python Steering Council. A core
developer who contributed to the new parser, revamped the error messages of
CPython in 3.9, then in 3.10, and now in 3.12. Did I mention he added the first
JIT to Python as part of his support for the Linux ``perf`` tool? Yeah, he did.

He's also a physicist specializing in black holes and a master at card tricks.
If all that isn't enough to impress you, listen to his flawless ultra-fast
rendition of Isaac Albéniz's “Asturias”.

10. Here Comes The Sun
----------------------

We miss Ewa Jodłowska at the Python Software Foundation! She was part of the
organization for many years. In this intimate performance, she plays the
Beatles standard on violin alongside her teacher, Brittany Nelson.

11. The Zen of Python
---------------------

The perfect closing track. Python's “Friendly Uncle for Life” takes the text of
PEP 20 and writes an entire song around it. He's truly the
multi-instrumentalist: he sings and plays bass, guitar, and keyboards in the
song. Barry even wrote `a detailed post about how he went about it
<https://www.wefearchange.org/2020/05/zenofpython.rst.html>`_.

The physical side of the record
===============================

The actual vinyl record is transparent. Each side contains a unique sticker.
The front cover is a play on Pink Floyd's “Dark Side of the Moon”, drawn in
8-bit computer style. The center snakes are a variation of the ``python.exe``
icon from the early 2000s. It's unclear at this point who the author of that
icon was, maybe Mark Hammond? The variation uses the Mayan snakes/yin-yang
shape and colors of the current Python logo. Hopefully, all those cues
translate naturally to Python community members!

The back cover mimics the Joy Division cover of “Unknown Pleasures”, which was
created by graphing signals from pulsar B1919+21. This version is a recreation
using Python 3.8 and Matplotlib using data from that same pulsar gathered at
the time of producing the record (late 2019).

The digital files
=================

The highest bidder will get the physical record, but they will also receive a
bundle with the digital audio files. If they so choose, they can share the
files with other people. Should they choose not to, the record will continue
existence as a globally unique item. Comparisons with the last Wu-Tang Clan
album not unfounded!

You should bid on it
====================

This was a lot of work, but mostly it was a fun project to do. We're sure the
end result is a worthy piece for the PyLadies Auction. Not only is this a
one-off unique vinyl record that is a heartfelt snapshot of a moment in time
for Python, but the money all goes to a good cause! We hope to see you in Salt
Lake City for the conference. Don't be a stranger and say “Hi!”
