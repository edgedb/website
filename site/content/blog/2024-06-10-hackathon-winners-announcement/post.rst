Announcing the winners of our hackathon!
========================================

We are thrilled to announce the winners of our hackathon, which took place
from April 26th to May 26th. This event brought together developers of all
skill levels to create, learn, and connect. Participants showcased their
talents, acquired new skills, and met fellow developers, all while building
creative applications using EdgeDB, Vercel, and EdgeDB Cloud.

The hackathon was a huge success, with over 100 participants and 30 projects
submitted. We were impressed by the quality and creativity of the projects,
which ranged from design inspiration tools to conversational forms and AI
debaters.
